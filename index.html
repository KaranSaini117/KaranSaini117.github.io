    <h2> About Them </h2>
    
    <p class = "about-them-p">
      Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles, California.[1][2] It currently consists of lead vocalist Adam Levine, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Jesse Carmichael, bassist Mickey Madden, lead guitarist James Valentine, drummer Matt Flynn, keyboardist PJ Morton and multi-instrumentalist Sam Farrar. Original members Levine, Carmichael, Madden and drummer Ryan Dusick first came together as Kara's Flowers in 1994, while they were still in high school. After self-releasing their independent album We Like Digging?, the band signed to Reprise Records and released their only album The Fourth World in 1997. The album garnered a tepid response, after which the record label dropped the band and the members focused on college.
